 Guardian X üõ°Ô∏è

**The Most Advanced Solana Token Security Scanner**

Guardian X is the #1 comprehensive security platform for Solana tokens, providing real-time threat detection, AI-powered audits, and wallet protection. Built for traders, developers, and communities who demand the highest level of security.



 Why Guardian X is the Best
-Real-Time DexScreener Integration
- **Live Liquidity Data**: Fetches real USD liquidity values from DexScreener API
- **Market Intelligence**: Real-time price, volume, and FDV tracking
- **Accurate Detection**: $76K liquidity? We'll show it as SAFE, not a false honeypot

### Smart Risk Analysis
- **$50K+ Liquidity = Automatic Safe Rating**: High liquidity makes rug pulls economically unfeasible
- **Intelligent Scoring**: Considers liquidity amount, lock status, volume, and on-chain data
- **Context-Aware**: Mint authority only flagged as risk when combined with low liquidity

### Comprehensive Security Checks
-  Real liquidity verification via DexScreener
-  Honeypot detection using on-chain data
-  Rug pull risk assessment
-  Mint & freeze authority verification
-  Transfer restrictions analysis
-  Tax calculation (buy/sell)
-  Volume & market activity tracking
-  AI-powered audit reports

 Features That Make Us #1
 1. Real Liquidity Verification
Unlike other scanners that use mock simulations, we fetch actual liquidity data from DexScreener:
```javascript
    Guardian X
const liquidityUsd = await fetchFromDexScreener(tokenAddress)
if (liquidityUsd >= 50000) markAsSafe()

// ‚ùå Other scanners
if (mockSimulation.failed) markAsHoneypot() // Often wrong!
```

  2. Smart Context-Aware Analysis
- High liquidity ($50K+) ‚Üí Safe even if not explicitly locked
- Medium liquidity ($10K-$50K) unlocked ‚Üí Suspicious
- Low liquidity (<$10K) ‚Üí High risk
- No liquidity ‚Üí Honeypot

 3. AI-Powered Comprehensive Audits
- Uses Google Gemini AI
- Analyzes all metrics holistically
- Provides human-readable explanations
- Scores tokens 0-100 with detailed findings

 4. Wallet Protection
- Dust token detection
- Real-time wallet analysis
- Simulated transaction testing
- Risk score for holdings

 5. Beautiful, Professional UI
- Dark mode optimized
- Real-time statistics dashboard
- Animated risk meters
- Color-coded threat levels
- Mobile responsive
